# Content-aware-Neuron-Image-Enhancement
This is the implementation of our paper on neuron image enhancement in ICIP 2016 and TIP 2019.

## Introduction
By exploring the property of sparsity and tube-like structure in the neuron images, we formulate high quality neuron images with a cost function. By minimizing the cost function iteratively, neuron images wiht clutter and noise are gradually removed. For more details about this work, please refer to our publication in ICIP 2016[^1] and TIP 2019 [^2].
